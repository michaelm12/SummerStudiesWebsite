        <p id="p1">It is never too early to start planning your summer! Many structured summer programs and camps have deadlines in January and February. This Summer Program Sampler is meant to be a sampling of summer programs; it is not an exhaustive list. For more opportunities, please visit <a href="www.summerprogramfinder.com">www.summerprogramfinder.com</a>, <a href="www.enrichmentalley.com">www.enrichmentalley.com</a>, <a href="www.teenlife.com">www.teenlife.com</a>, or <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>.</p>

        <p id="p2">You donâ€™t have to pay for a structured summer program in order to have a valuable summer experience! Colleges are just as excited about students who work at paying jobs or spend their summers volunteering. For community service ideas, please visit www.dosomething.org, view a listing of local opportunities in Naviance (<a href="http://connection.naviance.com/steds/">http://connection.naviance.com/steds/</a>), or see your college counselor.</p>
