The training is objective and centers on the structure of city, county, and state governments operated by students elected to various offices.

        <p><b>Girls State, FL</b><br>
        High school girls who have completed their junior year spend an intensive week of study, working together as self-governing citizens. These young women learn government by actually creating a mythical state through the election of public officials on local, county and state levels and then by carrying out the duties of these respective offices. Two citizens from each Girls State are selected to participate in the annual Girls Nation program. This is a hands-on educational workshop, focusing on Americanism and the political process, sponsored by the Florida American Legion Auxiliary. The goal of the program is to help students to better understand democratic ideals and the part we as individuals play in carrying out these ideals.
